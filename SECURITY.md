# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We will make every effort to address the issue promptly. To report a vulnerability, please use the following contact method:

- **Email**: mahdi0dev@gmail.com
- **Preferred communication language**: English & Persian

Please include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact, and any suggestions you may have for resolving it.

We ask that you do **not** disclose the vulnerability publicly or share it with others until we have had a chance to address it. Once the issue is resolved, we will notify the relevant stakeholders and, if appropriate, credit you for your contribution.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
